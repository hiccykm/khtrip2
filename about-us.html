         <p id="u12267-3">&nbsp;</p>
         <p id="u12267-5">We participate in clubs, and teachers encourage everyone to participate in the 2025&nbsp;&nbsp; Cyberfair.. This year's theme is to show Taiwan's life and vitality. We are in the first grade. Everyone is participating in an online blog competition for the first time. Everything is rusty. After waiting for the task to be completed, we find that we have learned a lot and broadened our horizons. Our school is located near the Zuoying District of Kaohsiung, so after school, we occasionally meet some foreign and foreign tourists. This sparked our interest in doing something for our hometown. Why don't we set up a website to introduce this historic place and let more people come here? Classmates work together, work together, and are determined to do it well.</p>
         <p id="u12267-6">&nbsp;</p>
         <p id="u12267-8">During the winter vacation, there was a Chiikawa exhibition in Kaohsiung Port, a market in Pier&#45;2 Art, and a temple fair in Zuoying, so we divided into groups and divided the work. Each group had a responsible student to take pictures and remind students to record videos because they had to make videos. At the same time, the web design students also started to make web pages. The instructor discussed the progress of web page creation with students through the LINE group on their mobile phones. Understand the progress of students in completing the task of taking photos at various tourist attractions.</p>

The delicious food at Liuhe Night Market really makes me drool. This competition not only allowed me to introduce Kaohsiung, but also taught me how to describe the charm of the city in an interesting and emotional way.</span></p>

I had the opportunity to visit the director&#45;general of Qimingtang, the proprietress of the Councilor Chen Meijuan. During the visit, everyone seemed to be chatting. It was very smooth and natural. There was no tension or embarrassment. The result was even more rewarding.</p>

Title: Teacher of Data Processing Teaching subjects: web design planning guidance, database Guiding experience:
Through the division of thematic production, students' ability to unite and assist each other, communication and coordination is tested. Students learn to take pictures, collect information, make web pages, make movies, and have the ability to visit. Especially in the visit, students learn how to contact and arrange. Pre&#45;conceived access to topic content, all of which are very rare learning experiences. This year is suitable for Wuhan Pneumonia. Students have postponed the opening of school, so some works are not perfect and they are completed in a hurry. All these are very rare learning experiences. At the same time, through this special topic, let me experience the historical landmarks and places of interest in Kaohsiung City. I hope that through the introduction of the blog, I can attract more people to experience this beautiful city during the holidays. Instructor: Meng&#45;Ting Chang

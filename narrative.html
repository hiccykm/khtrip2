         <p id="u5420-7">&nbsp;</p>
         <p id="u5420-9">Description of our local community:</p>
         <p id="u5420-11">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kaohsiung is located at the southernmost tip of Taiwan. In 1979, it included 11 districts including Yancheng, Gushan, Zuoying, Nanzi, Sanmin, Xinxing, Qianjin, Qianzhen, Qijin, and Xiaogang. These areas total 35 districts, including 27 townships and cities, including former Kaohsiung County, Fengshan, Okayama, Qishan, Mino and Binlin. Kaohsiung has bright sunshine all year round and a pleasant climate. The people are naive and enthusiastic. This city with mountains, rivers, oceans, ports and airports has successfully used its rich historical humanities, mountains and marine resources to develop into a potential tourist city, many popular attractions and historical heritage, worth exploring and leaving behind beautiful Memories.</p>
         <p id="u5420-12">&nbsp;</p>
         <p id="u5420-14">Summary of the case study plan:</p>
         <p id="u5420-16">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kaohsiung's historical monuments are historical places of historical development in Kaohsiung. They have rich cultural heritage, and there are many historical monuments, temples or historic sites left over. During the holidays, tourists enjoy visiting Kaohsiung, exploring its culture and history, and tasting delicious food. All this enriches our cultural content in Kaohsiung. Get opinions and suggestions about Kaohsiung by interviewing members of parliament, residents, etc. Through our website, we hope readers can learn more about the history of Kaohsiung and learn to cherish and protect it.</p>
         <p id="u5420-17">&nbsp;</p>
         <p id="u5420-19">Our internet environment:</p>
         <p id="u5420-21">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because some classmates do not have a computer at home, everyone usually uses the school's broadband connection to search for information, and integrates them through the computer in the school's computer classroom. After discussion, they record the places that need to be strengthened, and each find their own responsibility. Part of the data will be discussed with each other during the computer class of the school, and each person will put forward the work progress of each person, so that the instructor can master the progress of the topic research.</p>
         <p id="u5420-22">&nbsp;</p>
         <p id="u5420-24">Challenges we overcome:</p>
         <p id="u5420-26">Lack of time and experience</p>
         <p id="u5420-28">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each member of our group is participating in the Internet Expo for the first time. I feel very fresh and curious. I have no previous experience in participating in similar competitions. In the case of inexperience, I do n’t know where to start, so it took me a long time to Exploring, plus we usually have a lot of activities and tasks, facing a lot of school pressure is really not small, we need to spare extra time to visit the remote tribes of the country surname, each member is very willing to cooperate with all tasks and visits Time, although we are the first time to contact the International CyberFair, but the effort was successfully completed.</p>
         <p id="u5420-29">&nbsp;</p>
         <p id="u5420-31">Collection and integration of data</p>
         <p id="u5420-33">&nbsp; Most of the research topics in this study were first searched by the Internet for relevant information. The other landscapes were practiced, step by step, and photographs were recorded along the road. However, there are some historical parts. It must be from other documents and historical materials, so collecting information and unifying is also a problem for the team, but under the mutual efforts of members and the guidance of the teacher, it is still completed at the last moment, so that everyone in the member can know The ability to integrate is very important.</p>
         <p id="u5420-34">&nbsp;</p>
         <p id="u5420-36">Experience Proverbs:</p>
         <p id="u5420-38">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this opportunity, it is also our experience in participating in the International CyberFair for the first time. The entire process, planning, and even the final entry page not only make us more mature in operation technology, but also make more unexpected beautiful journeys. In addition, we get It is a spiritual gain. We have n’t understood anything about a topic. Until now, we have gradually learned about the topic. The teamwork of the group members can successfully complete this topic. The biggest credit is that the teacher carefully guides us and lets us know where This amendment and improvement also guides us to the right exploration purpose, so that we have further growth during this time, learned the teamwork and spirit of the team, I believe that this thematic production experience will be very great for our future s help.</p>

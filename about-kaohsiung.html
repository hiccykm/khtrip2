         <p id="u8929-5"><span id="u8929-4">Since 1945, military families from all over the mainland have settled in various parts of Taiwan. Time flies, the years go by, and the unique cultural atmosphere of the village is a hometown flavor that many people miss. According to statistics from the Ministry of National Defense in 2005, there were 886 dependent villages under national control. After the merger of Kaohsiung City, counties and cities, it also possessed land, sea, and air army families, and preserved nearly 90 hectares of cultural villages, the largest area in China.</span></p>
         <p id="u8929-6">&nbsp;</p>
         <p id="u8929-8">The characteristic value of Kaohsiung's dependent villages includes the three forces of land, sea, and air. The navy's dependent villagers are located in Zuoying, the Air Force's dependent villages are located in Okayama, and the army dependent villages are located in Fengshan. The Kaohsiung Left Battalion, with its navy as its base camp, has the largest navy dependent village in Taiwan. Among them, Mingde Xincun is known as the &quot;General Village&quot; because it has lived with many high&#45;ranking generals. In 1996, the &quot;National Army Reconstruction Regulations for Old Families&quot; accelerated the disappearance of settlements in Taiwan's dependent villages. The Secretary&#45;General of the Presidential Palace Chen Ju actively sought retention from the Ministry of National Defense during the mayor of Kaohsiung. The protection plan broke through the predicament of preservation, and in 2016 won the Ministry of Culture's protection of the cultural assets of the village. The new star project &quot;Renovation and Display Promotion Project of Fengshan Huangpu New Village Buildings in Kaohsiung City&quot; and &quot;Activation and Reactivation of Cultural Landscape of Zuoying Navy Village in Kaohsiung City Utilizing the support of the plan, in 2017, we will expand and launch the upgraded version of “Residential Care ‧ Talent Base”, “Residential Care ‧ Public Housing Repair”, “Residential Care ‧ Old House Labor Camp”, “ “Residence care and home care for the village” has been restored, so far 133 households have been restored, and 91 households have entered the residential construction industry and Huangpu New Village, hoping to continue the rich life texture and living functions of the family.</p>
